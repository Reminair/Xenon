# xenonOS
Welcome to the Official xenon github!

## What is xenon?

Well it's sort of confusing, but i will try to keep it simple.

xenon Is what is described as a "placeboOS", it's a program that tries to act, behave, and look like an OS but is not its own independant OS.

## What are the features?

Well its a pretty small list right now, but as me and my team learn rust, it will get more extensive as we go.

### Fakeboot:

Its not very good looking for now, but fakeboot basically just makes it feel like your bootinmg into an OS
